But, in some cases, there has been several developers which has found that not always the parallel stream works better than the serial stream (or even the traditional for or foreach loops to iterate over a collection).<br>In this talk we will take a look at the Streams performance and we will present some of the elements that could affect the performance.<br>We will also present the mechanisms under the Parallel Stream in order to know better the way it works and to try to understand what could affect to the performance of a parallel stream",

The physical devices, layout and algorithms we use affect cost, efficiency and site capacity – getting it right is worth millions.<br>Making highly optimal choices for these three aspects is often beyond human capability. We can either optimise and test by trial and error in production, which is expensive, risky and slow, or we can write software to test our systems and identify highly optimal choices for us.<br>Learn how we use Discrete Event Simulation to test production applications, predict operational performance, and optimise physical layouts, hardware design and control algorithms. Discrete Event Simulation gives us scenario and full production case testing capability. These tests are deterministic, making debugging faster and simpler, and preventing erroneous test failures. Each test can complete faster than real-time meaning that you can afford to add a vast amount of tests without excessively slowing down your development cycle.  Come along and I’ll show you how this can be done.",

Currently, developers can detect automatically which parts of your code are violating a specific code convention through static analysis tools such as SonarQube.<br>However, after having a detailed report about which parts of the code contain bad programming practices, developers need to fix them manually using their favorite editor over and over again even if the solution is completely simple and deterministic. To solve this problem, we have created Walkmod, an open source tool to share and automatically fix code conventions.<br>In this session we will introduce Walkmod and  we will explain how to configure it to automatically fix our sonar rules using one of the most important java open source project.",
